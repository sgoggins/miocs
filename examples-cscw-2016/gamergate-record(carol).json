				"title": {Gamergate Tweets, 2015-01-22},
				"abstract": {The Collaboration and Social Media Lab at the Illinois Institute of Technology started collecting tweets tagged #gamergate in October, 2014, storing them in a MySQL database. On February 11, 2016, a random sample of 1,000 tweets posted on January 22, 2015 were extracted from the database and stored in a file called gamergatetweets_021116.txt. The purpose of this extraction is to identify positive examples of the CASM Lab's Online Verbal Violence scale, specifically scale items relating to threats. We picked January 22, 2015 because a #gamergate news article was posted on January 15, but there was a gap in the data between 1/15 and 1/21. We will be sending a 100-tweet subset of this collection to Amazon Mechanical Turk to be coded. The coded tweets will then be used to train machine learning classifiers that we hope to use to validate the Online Verbal Violence scale.},
